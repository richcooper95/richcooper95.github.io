Write your blog post content here in Markdown format.

## Headers work like this

- Lists work
- Like this

```python
# Code blocks work like this
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

And you can include [links](https://example.com) and *formatting* too.

## Adding Images

You can include images in your blog posts in several ways:

1. From a local file (place image in the same directory as your .md file):
   ![Local Image](image.jpg)

2. From a subdirectory:
   ![Subdirectory Image](images/photo.png)

3. From a URL:
   ![Remote Image](https://example.com/image.jpg)

Images will be automatically copied to the blog's image directory when you run the generation script.
