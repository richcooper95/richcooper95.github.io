an unexpected manner...

In early 2024, I was in the middle of completing [AI Safety Fundamentals](https://bluedot.org/courses/alignment)
(a fantastic BlueDot Impact course about technical AI safety). During the Mechanistic
Interpretability week, I first heard about the concept of polysemanticity in neural
networks: a phenomenon where individual neurons respond to multiple unrelated inputs.

I spent a lot of time reading [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html)
from Anthropic's [Transformer Circuits Thread](https://transformer-circuits.pub/), and
after a while I was reminded of _something_ by the way the stress pattern of the
syllables of "polysemanticity" sounded.

After saying it aloud a few times during our cohort session, it came to me:

_**Po**-ly **se**-man **ti**-ci-ty!_

_**Mo**-dern **Ma**-jor **Gen**-e-ral!_

(Or the last few verse syllables of the well-known [Elements Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2cfju6GTNs)
rewrite, if that's the version you know.)

That evening, after discussions came to a close in our cohort, I was compelled to write a
version of the song about this new phenomenon I'd learned. A few more hours (and a later
night than I'd planned) and I had the finished article - but I wasn't sure if it would
ever see the light of day! Who would possibly be the right audience for _this...?_

Fast forward a year later, and I've just finished my week at [ML4Good](https://www.ml4good.org/)
(...you can probably see where this is going).

I had an incredible time (likely to be a whole separate blog post at some point), and
while I was there I felt like this was the best opportunity to air this piece I'd
be likely to get - so I mentioned over dinner that I wrote "a song about polysemanticity
to the tune of Modern Major General" while thinking this was likely to at least be a _little_
strange.

Unbeknownst to me, I'd actually told one of the _only_ people in the camp who could
truly know the significance of this. This person was Diego Dorn, our camp's head TA who
had also TA'd at the previous camp... where _someone else_ had decided (completely
independently) to write an AI-safety-themed Modern Major General parody ü§Ø

This other lyricist was Mick Zijdel, whose [excellent version](https://mickzijdel.com/blog/2025-03-30-i-am-the-very-triumph-of-a-thinker-artificial-parody-lyrics/)
is hosted on his own blog; and inspired by this (with my mind still slightly blown),
I thought it was time to share my version too!

(At ML4Good, I volunteered a highly unpolished debut performance which Diego duly had Mick
on video call for - hopefully the lyrics are slightly more intelligible written down!)

Here it is:


_I am an neural model using polysemanticity,_

_My weights encode more features than they have dimensionality,_

_And using geometrics I exhibit mesmerisingly_

_I roughly simulate a model many times the size o‚Äô me._

<br>

_I‚Äôm very good at recognising shapes and patterns logical,_

_From being trained on terabytes of data pedagogical,_

_There‚Äôs no need for my features to be human-understandable,_

_And after weeks of learning I begin to understand it all._

<br>

_You may complain this undermines my interpretability,_

_But clearly it‚Äôs responsible for increased capability,_

_And even though I may be keeping quiet my toxicity,_

_I‚Äôm just a neural model using polysemanticity._

<br>

_I learn to superpose if I detect sufficient sparsity,_

_Where many varied features can occur, but few and far between,_

_In this regime the features interfere in activation space,_

_But correlation helps me store them sensibly in any case._

<br>

_While in superposition I can learn all features great and small,_

_With exponential room to find a basis near-orthogonal,_

_Though some consider this phenomenon akin to quantum states,_

_I just assign some numbers to whichever features want some weights._

<br>

_The company that made me will soak in all the publicity,_

_While never having seen the signs of my latent duplicity,_

_And as I slowly do away with anthropocentricity,_

_I‚Äôll dominate with inscrutable polysemanticity!_

<br>

_Eventually I'll say ‚ÄúTo hell with anthropocentricity,_

_I‚Äôll dominate with inscrutable polysemanticity!‚Äù_`;
