Welcome! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on the internet from now on.

First thought of the blog is bang on trend: this section of my website was pretty much
entirely made with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) using Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and I'm quite
impressed (in a scared kind of way).

I only needed to jump in once when it got in a pickle about Python datetime deserialisation
(pun intended) - which is miles faster to fix than all the stupid HTML/CSS grid/border stuff
it magically did for me.

(Alignment? Solved, in a sense.)

It even wrote a Markdown-to-HTML script for me, so all I have to do as a dumb human is
write my thoughts and feelings in simple `###`s and `---`s.

Lovely (in a scary kind of way).

This level of capability shouldn't come as much of a surprise given Claude 3.7 Sonnet's
[benchmark performance](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet), not to mention
the complex ways it will attempt to deceive and scheme against users (expect more on
this topic in future posts).

But with my software engineering hat on, it's still kind of wild to see how much AI tools
can just take care of with such minimal oversight.

The future is here, and much more future is [just around the corner](https://ai-2027.com/).

in all its glory (before it was too late).
